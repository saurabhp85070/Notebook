    "Now, **let's interpret the correlation matrix:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The diagonal elements (e.g., Math_Score vs. Math_Score, Science_Score vs. Science_Score, etc.) all have a correlation coefficient of 1.0 because a variable is perfectly correlated with itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The off-diagonal elements contain the correlation coefficients between different subject scores. \n",
    "\n",
    "**For example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Math_Score vs. Science_Score: The correlation coefficient between Math_Score and Science_Score is approximately 0.969. This indicates a very strong positive linear relationship between math scores and science scores. When students perform well in math, they tend to also perform well in science. The correlation is close to 1, which suggests that the two variables are highly positively correlated.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Math_Score vs. English_Score: The correlation coefficient between Math_Score and English_Score is approximately 0.687. This suggests a positive relationship between math scores and English scores, but it is weaker compared to the relationship between math and science scores. The correlation is positive, indicating that higher math scores are associated with higher English scores, but the correlation is not as strong as the one between math and science.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Math_Score vs. History_Score: The correlation coefficient between Math_Score and History_Score is approximately -0.866. This is a strong negative correlation. It indicates that as math scores increase, history scores tend to decrease, and vice versa. In other words, students who excel in math tend to perform poorly in history, and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Science_Score vs. English_Score: The correlation coefficient between Science_Score and English_Score is approximately 0.775. This suggests a positive relationship between science scores and English scores. When students perform well in science, they also tend to perform well in English, but again, this relationship is not as strong as the one between math and science.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Science_Score vs. History_Score: The correlation coefficient between Science_Score and History_Score is approximately -0.925. This is a very strong negative correlation, even stronger than the one between math and history scores. It indicates that as science scores increase, history scores tend to decrease, and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. English_Score vs. History_Score: The correlation coefficient between English_Score and History_Score is approximately -0.948. This is a very strong negative correlation, suggesting that as English scores increase, history scores tend to decrease, and vice versa. This is the strongest negative correlation in the matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, this correlation matrix provides valuable insights into the relationships between these test scores. It indicates strong positive correlations between math and science scores, science and English scores, and math and English scores. On the other hand, there are strong negative correlations between math and history scores, science and history scores, and English and history scores, suggesting that students who excel in one subject tend to struggle in the other."

Unsupervised learning means that a model does not have to be trained, and we do not need a \"target\" variable. This method can be used on any data to visualize and interpret the relationship between individual data points.\n",

Then, we join clusters together that have the shortest distance between them to create larger clusters. This step is repeated until one large cluster is formed containing all of the data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hierarchical clustering requires us to decide on both a distance and linkage method. We will use euclidean distance and the Ward linkage method, which attempts to minimize the variance between clusters."
