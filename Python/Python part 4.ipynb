    "\n",
    "`Instance state` is the data that is associated with a specific instance of a class. It is stored in the object's memory and is unique to that object. **For example**, if you have a class called Car, each instance of Car would have its own instance state, such as its color, make, and model.\n",

    "`Class state` is the data that is associated with the class itself, rather than with any specific instance of the class. It is stored in the class's memory and is shared by all instances of the class. **For example**, if you have a class called Car, the class state might include the number of cars that have been created, the average price of a car, and the most popular color for cars.\n",

For `example`, a method called set_color() could be used to change the color of a car. **Instance methods can also access and modify the class state**.

    "##### When to use static method:\n",
    "\n",
    "When we want to perform any operation which has something to do with other class object then we can use static method.\n",
    "\n",
    "A static method is used when you want to define a method inside a class but you do not need access to the instance or class itself. This method can be called on the class itself, without the need to create an instance of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some common use cases for static methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Utility functions that do not depend on the state of the object or class, for example, a function that performs a calculation or conversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Helper functions that operate on the input parameters but do not modify the state of the object or class, for example, a function that validates the input data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Factory functions that create instances of the class based on some input parameters, but do not depend on the state of the class, for example, a function that creates an instance of a date object from a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, static methods are useful when you need to perform some functionality that does not require access to the state of the class or instance, and you want to keep the method inside the class for better organization and encapsulation."

When we assign a value to the name or age attribute of a Person object, the corresponding setter method is automatically called to set the value of the attribute. In this example, we have added some additional validation to the age setter method to ensure that the age is not negative.\n",
