    "\n",
    "In Python, the single underscore prefix before a variable or method name is used as a naming convention to indicate that it is intended to be treated as \"protected\" or \"private\" member of a class. The purpose of using this convention is to signal to other developers that these members are not intended to be accessed or modified from outside the class, and should be considered internal implementation details of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is important to note that this convention is not enforced by the Python interpreter. In other words, Python does not provide any language-level mechanism to prevent external access to members that are marked as \"protected\" or \"private\" using the single underscore prefix. Instead, this is simply a naming convention that is widely used and respected by Python developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is still possible to access and modify \"protected\" or \"private\" members of a class from outside the class if desired. This means that Python relies on the developer community to respect the conventions and design principles that are established for Python programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth noting that the lack of strict enforcement of private members in Python is in line with the philosophy of the language, which emphasizes flexibility and readability over strict encapsulation. This allows Python developers to write code that is more concise and expressive, while still maintaining good programming practices and design principles."

    "Python does not have access specifiers in the same way that some other object-oriented programming languages like C++ or Java have. In those languages, access specifiers like public, private, and protected are used to control the visibility of members of a class, and to restrict or allow access to those members from outside the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, however, access to class members is controlled mainly by naming conventions. The single underscore prefix is used to indicate that a member is intended to be \"protected\" or \"private\", and the double underscore prefix is used to indicate \"name mangling\", which makes it more difficult to access the member from outside the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it's important to understand that these are just conventions, and they are not enforced by the Python interpreter. In other words, any member of a class in Python can be accessed from outside the class if desired, regardless of whether it has a single or double underscore prefix.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's approach to access control reflects the language's philosophy of \"we're all consenting adults here\". The idea is that developers are expected to follow best practices and to respect each other's code, rather than relying on strict access control mechanisms to enforce good programming practices. This approach allows Python developers to write more flexible and expressive code, while still maintaining good design principles and practices."

    "\n",
    "To avoid name collisions between the private variables in the superclass and the subclass, we use name mangling to modify the name of the variable in the superclass. The name of the variable in the superclass is modified to _MyClass__private_var, and the name of the variable in the subclass is modified to _MySubclass__private_var. This ensures that each variable has a unique name that includes the name of its class as a prefix.\n",
    "\n",
    "To access the private variable in the subclass, we use the modified name _MyClass__private_var. This syntax allows us to access the private variable of the superclass from the subclass, even though the variable has been modified by name mangling.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, name mangling is a useful technique for implementing encapsulation and preventing accidental name collisions in Python classes. It is mainly used to modify the names of class members to make them more difficult to access from outside the class, and to ensure that each member has a unique name that includes the name of its class as a prefix."

The sales section also handles all sales-related activities. They keep records of all sales. Sometimes, a finance official may need all sales data for a specific month. In this instance, he is not permitted to access the data from the sales section. First, he will need to contact another officer from the sales section to request the data. This is encapsulation. The data for the sales section, as well as the employees who can manipulate it, are all wrapped together under the single name \"sales section\". Encapsulation is another way to hide data. This example shows that the data for sections such as sales, finance, and accounts are hidden from all other sections."
