    "Example: \n",
    "- `CREATE`: CREATE TABLE EMPLOYEE(Name VARCHAR2(20), Email VARCHAR2(100), DOB DATE);  \n",
    "- `DROP`: DROP TABLE EMPLOYEE;  \n",
    "- `ALTER`: ALTER TABLE STU_DETAILS ADD(ADDRESS VARCHAR2(20));  \n",

    "**DML**: Data manipulation language. It is used to modify the database. It is not autocommitted. \n",

    "Example:\n",
    "- `INSERT`: INSERT INTO javatpoint (Author, Subject) VALUES (\"Sonoo\", \"DBMS\");   \n",
